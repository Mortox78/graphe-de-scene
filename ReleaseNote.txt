//===================== Graphe de scÃ¨ne ==================//

By : Steeven NOVO
Released the : 20/12/2019

//===================== DESCRIPTION ==================//

This project consisted to create a tree of objects/referentials
which will be displayed on the screen by using my own transformation
matrix. We had to create a recursive function and display every objects.

//===================== HOW TO BUILD ==================//

First, make sure that no indiresable files are present by using
the command "make clean", then use the command "make" to make
the executable appear ( "grph" )

//===================== HOW TO RUN ==================//

After having built the project, make it run by using the command
"./grph". If it doesn't run, try to rebuild it by using the command
"make clean" and "make".


//===================== FEATURES ==================//

We're in a 3D environment, spheres, cylinders, and cubes can be drawn.
The current tree of objects in my project is = world --> sphere --> cube --> cylinder

There is a prepared "main" where you will be able to test the project.
You can translate/scale the sphere by using :
- TRANSLATION : "directional arrows", "space" and "left control"
- SCALE       : "+" and "-" from the key panel

//===================== TECHNIQUES USED ==================//

OpenGL 3, my own transformation matrix.

//===================== NOT ADDED FEATURES & BUGS ==================//

- XML not added.

//===================== FILES LOCATIONS ==================//

Matrix classes are in the folder "snmath"
- matrix.cpp
- matrix.h
- matrix4.cpp
- matrix4.h

There is a 30 seconds video of the project in the folder "media" (.MP4).
